\title{Attribute-space Presence–Absence Matrix (attrPAM)}
\usage{
lets.attrpam(
  x,
  n_bins = 10,
  remove.cells = TRUE,
  remove.sp = TRUE,
  count = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame where the first column contains species (character vector),
and the next two columns contain numeric trait values (2D space).}

\item{n_bins}{Integer. Number of bins per axis (default = 10).}

\item{remove.cells}{Logical. If `TRUE`, remove empty cells from the PAM (default).}

\item{remove.sp}{Logical. If `TRUE`, remove species absent from all cells (default).}

\item{count}{Logical. If `TRUE`, display a text progress bar while building the PAM.}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\itemize{
  \item \code{PAM_attribute}: a matrix with cell ID, trait coordinates, and species presence (0/1).
  \item \code{Attr_Richness_Raster}: a raster of richness (number of species) in trait space.
}
}
\description{
Builds a presence–absence matrix (PAM) in a two-dimensional **trait space**,
by binning species occurrences along two quantitative attributes (e.g., body size and mass).
Each species can have one or multiple entries in the trait dataset.
}
\details{
Create a Presence–Absence Matrix in Trait Space


The two trait axes are divided into equal-interval bins, generating a grid of
`n_bins × n_bins` cells. Each species occurrence is assigned to a cell, and
the resulting PAM indicates which species are present in each trait cell.
